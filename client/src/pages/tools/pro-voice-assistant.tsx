Check the ignition sequence: induced draft motor energizes first, pressure switch closes, then ignition begins.

High static pressure from dirty filters, closed dampers, or undersized ductwork forces the system to overheat and trip on limit switches. Check the heat exchanger for cracks using a combustible gas detector during operation. Verify the limit switch is properly calibrated and not nuisance tripping.

Measure temperature rise across the heat exchanger - it should match manufacturer specifications within 40-70°F typically. Check refrigerant subcooling and superheat for cooling systems.

Combustion air calculations use CSA B149.1 methods - typically 1 cubic foot per 1000 BTU input for outdoor air.

Design temperatures use 99% heating and 1% cooling values for your location. Equipment selection uses Manual S guidelines - heating capacity should be 100-125% of calculated load, cooling capacity 95-115%.

For field charging, measure suction line temperature and pressure to calculate superheat - typically 8-12°F for TXV systems, 10-15°F for fixed orifices. Subcooling should be 8-15°F measured at the liquid line near the condenser. Use calibrated digital manifolds for accuracy. Check for leaks using electronic leak detectors sensitive to 0.1 oz/year.

Measure voltage drops across connections and verify proper wire sizing - 18 AWG minimum for most applications. For communicating systems, use manufacturer-specific diagnostic tools to check bus communication, address conflicts, and error codes.

Verify defrost termination using coil temperature sensors, typically 65-70°F. Check reversing valve operation using solenoid voltage and system pressures.

Calculate combustion efficiency using flue gas temperature rise above combustion air temperature.
