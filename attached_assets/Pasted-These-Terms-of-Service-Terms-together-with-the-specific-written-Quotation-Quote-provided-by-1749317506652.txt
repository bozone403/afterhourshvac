These Terms of Service ("Terms"), together with the specific written Quotation ("Quote") provided by AfterHours HVAC ("Company") to the individual or entity identified therein ("Client"), constitute the binding legal agreement governing the provision of heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), and related sheet metal equipment and services (collectively, the "Work").



I. AGREEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE
A. Binding Effect: These Terms, in conjunction with the specific Quote accepted by the Client, form the complete and binding legal agreement between the Company and the Client. Acceptance of the Quote by any means (including, without limitation, written confirmation, electronic acceptance, or remittance of any payment towards the Quote) shall constitute the Client's unconditional and irrevocable acceptance of, and agreement to be legally bound by, these Terms in their entirety.
B. Superseding Effect: These Terms supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written,1 between the parties with respect to the subject matter2 hereof. No other terms, conditions, stipulations, or representations shall have any force or effect unless expressly memorialized in a written instrument duly executed by an authorized officer of the Company.
C. Conflict Resolution: In the event of a direct and irreconcilable conflict between a provision of these Terms and a specific line item description pertaining solely to the identification of Work components or pricing within the accepted Quote, the specific description or pricing line item in the Quote shall govern solely with respect to that discrete point of conflict. All other terms, obligations, conditions, warranties, liabilities, payment structures, and procedures shall be governed exclusively and strictly by these Terms.
D. Opportunity for Independent Legal Advice: The Client acknowledges having been afforded adequate opportunity to review these Terms and the associated Quote, and the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice prior thereto, and confirms acceptance hereof voluntarily and with full understanding of the terms herein.
II. SCOPE OF WORK
A. Defined Exclusively by Quote: The Company's sole obligation is to perform the Work explicitly and specifically detailed within the written Quote document, identified by Quote number and/or date, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully. Any ambiguity regarding the scope shall be interpreted strictly against inclusion unless the item or service is expressly listed and detailed within the said Quote.
B. Standard Inclusions (If Specified in Quote): Work generally includes the supply and installation of equipment and components expressly itemized in the Quote, standard connections to existing utility points deemed compatible and code-compliant by the Company in its sole discretion, and removal of debris directly generated by the Company's installation activities.
C. Express Exclusions and Client Responsibility: The following items and services are expressly and absolutely excluded from the Scope of Work unless each is specifically itemized, described, and priced within the accepted Quote or a subsequent written Change Order executed in accordance with Section VII hereof. The Client assumes sole responsibility, cost, and liability for:
Thermostats: Supply, installation, programming, configuration, or replacement thereof.
Existing Systems: Any modification, repair, cleaning, balancing, upgrading, or servicing of the Client's pre-existing ductwork, registers, grilles, ventilation system components, electrical panels, wiring, circuit breakers, or gas lines, beyond the immediate point of final connection required for the installed equipment.
Structural Work: Any alterations, repairs, or modifications to the property's structure, including walls, ceilings, floors, roofing, or foundations.
Cosmetic Restoration: Any repair or restoration of cosmetic finishes, including, without limitation, drywall, paint, plaster, wallpaper, flooring, or landscaping disturbed during the execution of the Work.
Hazardous Materials: The identification, testing, handling, abatement, removal, and disposal of any hazardous or deleterious substances encountered on site (including, but not limited to, asbestos, mold, lead, or other toxins). Should such materials be suspected or discovered, the Company reserves the absolute right to immediately cease Work in the affected area; the Client shall bear all costs associated with the assessment, abatement, and disposal by qualified third parties, as well as any and all costs incurred by the Company due to resultant delays, demobilization, and remobilization.
Unforeseen or Concealed Conditions: Addressing any site conditions not reasonably apparent or discoverable during the initial assessment (e.g., hidden structural defects, non-compliant pre-existing installations, inadequate utility capacity). Such conditions necessitate a Change Order at the Client's sole expense.
System Balancing: Any balancing, airflow adjustments, or commissioning procedures beyond the Company's standard initial start-up test procedures.
Existing Equipment Disposal: The removal from site, handling, or disposal of any of the Client's pre-existing equipment being replaced or decommissioned as part of the Work.
Miscellaneous: Any item, task, or service not explicitly and unambiguously listed as an included item within the accepted Quote.

A. Total Price: The price payable by the Client for the Work shall be the amount specified in the accepted Quote ("Total Price"), exclusive of applicable taxes.
B. Taxes: The Client shall pay the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and any other applicable federal or provincial taxes levied on the Total Price, which shall be itemized separately on invoices.
C. Payment Schedule: Time is of the essence for all payments. Unless explicitly stipulated otherwise in writing on the accepted Quote, the Client shall remit payments to the Company according to the following mandatory schedule:
First Payment: Forty percent (40%) of the Total Price, plus applicable GST, payable prior to the delivery of any equipment or the commencement of any on-site Work. Scheduling of Work is strictly conditional upon receipt of said payment in cleared funds.
Second Payment: Forty percent (40%) of the Total Price, plus applicable GST, payable immediately upon the Company's notification to the Client, determined in its reasonable assessment, that the "rough-in" stage of the Work is complete (defined as the installation of major indoor and/or outdoor units and associated primary lines/wiring, prior to final system connections, testing, and commissioning).
Final Payment: The remaining twenty percent (20%) balance of the Total Price, plus applicable GST and any outstanding charges, payable immediately upon the Company's notification to the Client, determined in its reasonable assessment, of substantial completion and readiness for final inspection and/or commissioning. Final inspection or commissioning procedures shall not be scheduled or performed until said final payment is received in cleared funds.
D. Accepted Methods: Payment shall be rendered via E-transfer to [email address removed] or Credit Card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express).

Personal or business cheques shall not be accepted.
E. Delinquent Accounts: Any portion of an invoice remaining unpaid upon its stated due date shall be deemed delinquent. Delinquent amounts shall immediately commence accruing interest at the rate of two and one-half percent (2.5%) per month, equating to an annual percentage rate of thirty percent (30.0%), calculated daily and compounded monthly on the outstanding balance until paid in full. Furthermore, upon any delinquency, the Company reserves the absolute right, without prejudice to any other remedies:

F. Property Lines and Private Utilities: Where Work involves exterior ground disturbance, the Client shall be solely responsible for accurately identifying and marking all property lines and the location of any privately owned underground utilities, conduits, or services prior to commencement.

Any assistance provided by the Company in facilitating manufacturer warranty claims is purely a courtesy, and associated labour costs beyond the limited Workmanship Warranty period defined below are chargeable to the Client.
B. Limited Workmanship Warranty: The Company warrants its installation labour against defects directly attributable to faulty installation workmanship (such as installation-related leaks or improper connections performed by the Company) for a period of one (1) calendar year commencing from the date of substantial completion of the Work ("Workmanship Warranty Period").

E. COMPREHENSIVE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES: EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS LIMITED WORKMANSHIP WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION VI(B) ABOVE, THE COMPANY PROVIDES THE WORK AND ANY ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS STRICTLY ON AN "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" BASIS.
