Here‚Äôs the direct execution strategy to reload your **AfterHours HVAC site** and **prove backend logic + UI rendering integrity** on **Replit**:

---

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP: FORCE RELOAD & VALIDATE SITE FUNCTIONALITY

### 1. **Force Application Rebuild**

Manually restart the development server in Replit:

* Go to Replit project console
* Run:

  ```bash
  kill 1
  ```

  *This forces Replit to restart the server and reload all routes, assets, and backend logic.*

### 2. **Trigger Full Client Rebuild**

In your Replit terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```

*This rebuilds the Vite frontend with latest changes. If you‚Äôre using `vite dev`, make sure any cached layout/components are flushed.*

### 3. **Check the Live Deployment Preview**

Once the build completes:

* Click the ‚ÄúOpen in a new tab‚Äù button from Replit‚Äôs preview pane.
* Confirm the **homepage, login/register, membership, and Pro Portal** are all reachable.

If the **live preview is blank or routes fail**, do this:

```bash
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

Want me to write a diagnostic checklist for Earl to verify internal systems automatically? Or set up a logging overlay to visualize user flow and trigger path failures?
