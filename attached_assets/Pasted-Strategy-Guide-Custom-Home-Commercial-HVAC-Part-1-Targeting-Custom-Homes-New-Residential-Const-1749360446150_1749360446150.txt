Strategy Guide: Custom Home & Commercial HVAC
Part 1: Targeting Custom Homes & New Residential Construction
This isn't about selling a box; it's about selling a partnership. Your audience isn't just a homeowner; it's the Custom Home Builder or the General Contractor. Their biggest fear is a sub-trade who is unreliable, messy, or holds up their entire project schedule. Your marketing needs to address this head-on.

Your Value Proposition (The Hook):
Reliability is Everything: You meet deadlines, period. You show up when you say you will, your installs are clean, and you integrate seamlessly with the other trades (plumbers, electricians, framers).

Design-First Approach: You don't just guess at sizes. You perform proper Manual J/S/D calculations to engineer a system that is perfectly sized for the home's unique design, ensuring flawless comfort and efficiency. You are a partner in building a high-performance home, not just a guy who installs a furnace.

Problem Prevention: Your meticulous work reduces the builder's biggest pain point: post-possession callbacks from the homeowner. A clean install today saves them a warranty headache tomorrow.

Website & Advertising Strategy:
Create a dedicated page on your site titled "For Builders & Custom Homes".

Headline: "Your Partner in Building Performance & Comfort." or "HVAC Solutions for Calgary's Premier Builders."

Opening Statement: Speak their language. "At AfterHours HVAC, we understand that a successful custom home build depends on reliable, professional trades who meet deadlines and deliver quality work. We specialize in providing design-first HVAC solutions that integrate seamlessly into your project timeline, reducing callbacks and ensuring total client satisfaction."

Key Sections:

Our Process: Lay out your workflow to show you're organized.

Blueprint Analysis: "We start with your architectural plans to perform comprehensive Manual J heat loss/gain calculations."

Phased Installation: "Our installation is phased to match your construction schedule, from rough-in to finishing, ensuring no delays."

Showcase Your Work: This is critical. Create a gallery of your cleanest new-build installs. Show tidy mechanical rooms, perfectly straight duct runs, and clean exterior penetrations. Before-and-afters aren't relevant here; it's all about showing pristine, professional work.

Call to Action (CTA): The CTA is not "Buy Now." It's professional.

"Partner with us on your next project. Submit your blueprints for a comprehensive bid."

Part 2: Targeting Light-to-Medium Commercial
This includes multi-family buildings, restaurants, retail spaces, offices, and warehouses. Your audience here is the General Contractor, the Property Manager, or the Business Owner. Their priority is protecting their investment and minimizing downtime.

Your Value Proposition (The Hook):
Protecting Their Asset: You're not just fixing a heater; you're maintaining a critical piece of their business infrastructure. Your service protects their asset, keeps tenants happy, and ensures business continuity.

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): Commercial clients think long-term. Your pitch should focus on how a properly installed and maintained system results in lower energy bills, fewer breakdowns, and a longer equipment lifespan, saving them money over the long run.

Preventive Maintenance is King: This is your primary goal. A signed Preventive Maintenance (PM) contract is predictable, recurring revenue. You're not just a repairman; you're their dedicated HVAC service provider.

Website & Advertising Strategy:
Create a dedicated page on your site titled "Commercial & Multi-Family HVAC Solutions".

Headline: "Reliable HVAC Solutions That Protect Your Business and Bottom Line."

Opening Statement: Show you understand their world. "For businesses and property managers in Calgary, HVAC system failure means lost revenue and unhappy tenants. AfterHours HVAC provides reliable commercial service, planned retrofits, and comprehensive maintenance contracts designed to maximize uptime and protect your investment."
