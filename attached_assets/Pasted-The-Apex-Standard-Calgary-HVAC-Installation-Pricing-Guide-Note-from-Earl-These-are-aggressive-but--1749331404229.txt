The Apex Standard: Calgary HVAC Installation Pricing Guide
Note from Earl: These are aggressive but realistic "Starting At" prices for the Calgary market, designed for competitive bidding. These prices assume a standard residential replacement and require maximum efficiency in labor and material purchasing to maintain profitability. Prices must increase for complex installations (e.g., attic installs, major venting changes, long lineset runs, electrical upgrades). All prices are pre-GST.
