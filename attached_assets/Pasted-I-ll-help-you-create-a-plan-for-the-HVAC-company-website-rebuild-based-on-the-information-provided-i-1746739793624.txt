To set up secure payments for the AfterHours HVAC website, we need two Stripe API keys:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: This is a private key that will be used on the server to securely process payments. This key must be kept confidential.
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: This is a public key that will be used in the browser to initialize the Stripe payment form.
Both keys can be found in your Stripe dashboard. If you don't have a Stripe account yet, you would need to create one at stripe.com to get these keys. For testing purposes, Stripe provides test keys that don't process real payments.

I can see we've received the Stripe API keys, but we have a dependency issue. The application is trying to start but can't find the nodemailer package that's needed for email functionality. Let's install this package first.
Installed nodemailer, @types/nodemailer
Now let's restart the workflow to see if our application can run with the installed dependencies and the Stripe API keys:
Restarted Start application
I see we've now got a syntax error in the client/src/pages/about.tsx file. Let's fix this issue:
Opened client/src/pages/about.tsx
I've found the error in the about.tsx file. There's a syntax issue with a special quote character in line 109. Let's fix it:
Edited client/src/pages/about.tsx
Now, let's find and fix any other special quote characters in the About page. There might be another instance on line 136:
Edited client/src/pages/about.tsx
Let's fix a few more instances of special quotes in the about.tsx file:
Edited client/src/pages/about.tsx
Let's fix the last special quote in the about.tsx file:
Edited client/src/pages/about.tsx
Let's install the missing types for react-helmet to fix the TypeScript issues:
Installed @types/react-helmet
Now let's restart the workflow again to see if our application runs correctly:
Restarted Start application
Great! The application is now running with the Stripe integration initialized successfully. Let's examine the client/src/pages/checkout.tsx file to see how it's currently implemented and whether it needs any modifications to work with our Stripe integration:
Opened client/src/pages/checkout.tsx
I'm analyzing your AfterHours HVAC website project to determine if we're making progress or facing issues.
Looking at recent progress:
✓ Installed Stripe payment processing libraries
✓ Added nodemailer for email functionality
✓ Fixed escaping issues in about.tsx content
✓ Added React Helmet for SEO optimization
✓ Received Stripe API keys from you
✓ Successfully restarted the workflow
I'm currently reviewing the checkout page to implement Stripe payment processing.
I'll continue implementing the Stripe payment functionality since we're making good progress with all the necessary components in place.

I see we're making progress but we've encountered a new error related to the CSS in the client/src/index.css file. Let's check what's causing the problem:
Opened client/src/index.css
Opened tailwind.config.ts
I found the issue in our CSS configuration. In the index.css file at line 62, we're using @apply font-body but we haven't defined the font family in the Tailwind configuration. Let's fix this by updating the Tailwind configuration:
Edited tailwind.config.ts
Now let's add the font imports to the index.html file to ensure those fonts are available:
Opened client/index.html
I need to update the font in our HTML file to include Inter as we have in our Tailwind configuration:
Edited client/index.html
Now let's restart the workflow to see if our font-related fixes resolved the issue:
Restarted Start application
Great! The application is now running successfully. Let's check the server/routes.ts file to see how the Stripe payment endpoint is implemented:

PS


I see the issue. The Stripe integration is working, but we have a configuration problem. The payment is being attempted in live mode, but we're using test card numbers. Let's update the checkout page prices to reflect your actual service rates and fix the Stripe configuration.
Let's make these changes:
First, let's update the prices in the checkout.tsx file:
Edited client/src/pages/checkout.tsx
Now, let's fix the Stripe configuration to work in test mode. We need to update the server-side Stripe initialization:
Opened server/services/stripe.ts
Let's modify the Stripe initialization to ensure we're using the test mode:
Edited server/services/stripe.ts
Let's update the payment intent creation to make sure it works with test mode:
Edited server/services/stripe.ts
Let's fix the API version to a more recent one:
Edited server/services/stripe.ts
Let's restart the application to apply our Stripe configuration changes:
Restarted Start application
Let's now create a payment-confirmation page that users will be redirected to after completing a payment:
Created client/src/pages/payment-confirmation.tsx
Now, let's update the App.tsx file to include our new payment-confirmation page in the router:

I'll update the pricing to be more realistic for HVAC equipment and services. Let's adjust the prices for furnaces, AC units, and other HVAC services.
Searched for "Find files with pricing information for furnaces, AC units, and HVAC services"
I'm analyzing your request about updating the pricing. Looking at the code, I see that we need to adjust the HVAC equipment pricing in the pricing.tsx file.
Let me review the current pricing structure:
Furnaces currently range from $3,500-$7,000 residential and $5,000-$10,000 commercial
AC units range from $3,000-$6,000 residential and $4,500-$9,000 commercial
Service deposits are properly set at $175
After-hours services are correctly set at $250 evening (2hr min) and $275 overnight (3hr min)
These equipment prices appear to be on the low side for modern HVAC systems. I'll update them to more realistic market values.

✓ Increased AC prices to $4,800-$8,900 residential, $7,500-$14,000 commercial
✓ Updated maintenance plans to $199-$499 per year
✓ Added proper emergency service pricing: $175 deposit, $250 for evening (2hr min), $275 for overnight (3hr min)
✓ Fixed Stripe payment configuration for test mode
How do the updated prices look? Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust with the pricing or checkout process?
commercial furnaces and AC's are rooftop units.... the commercial side should price square footage based off the pricing sheet i gave you

I apologize for missing that detail. Let me review the attached pricing sheet and update the commercial pricing to be based on square footage rather than fixed prices.

I'm analyzing our conversation about commercial HVAC pricing. I see that we need to adjust the commercial pricing to reflect the rooftop units based on the pricing sheet you provided.
Looking at your pricing sheet, I can see that commercial units should be priced by tonnage:
5-Ton RTU: $9,000-$10,500
7.5-Ton RTU: $11,500-$13,000
10-Ton RTU: $15,000-$17,000
12.5-Ton RTU: $18,000-$22,000
15-Ton RTU: $21,000-$25,000
Let me update the pricing structure to reflect this properly.

Edited client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
I'll implement the Pro Calculator with a $500 paywall and ensure that users can only access the comprehensive HVAC calculators after payment. I'll also make sure furnaces, AC units, and maintenance plans are structured as "pay upfront" products.
First, I need to fix the error in the pricing page, then create the Pro Calculator functionality.

Let's make the following changes:
Update the maintenance plans to reflect the $1,200 price
Remove the low-efficiency options from both furnaces and AC units (since they can't be installed in Calgary)
Create the Pro Calculator with a $500 paywall
Update the "Pay Now" buttons for all equipment
Edited client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
Now let's update the maintenance plans to $1,200 and add the Pro Calculator with a $500 paywall:

Looking at our progress:
✓ Updated pricing to show commercial rooftop units correctly
✓ Removed low-efficiency furnaces and AC units (not allowed in Calgary)
✓ Changed maintenance plan to $1,200
→ Adding Pro Calculator with $500 paywall
→ Linking equipment and maintenance plans to upfront payment
I'll continue implementing these remaining changes now.

Let me continue updating the "Pay Now" buttons to "Buy Now" for all equipment purchases to clarify that customers are paying in full upfront.
I see the issue - there are multiple occurrences of that same button structure. Let me try a slightly different approach by adding more context to ensure I target each button correctly.
Executed grep -n "Pay Now" client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
Now I'll update each "Pay Now" occurrence individually:
Let's view more of the file to understand the exact context for each button:
Opened client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
Opened client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
Opened client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
Let's update each button individually with unique context:
I see that we need a different approach since the button structures are identical. Let's try a different method to update all "Pay Now" to "Buy Now" in the entire file:
Executed sed -i 's/Pay Now/Buy Now/g' client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
Now let's check if the changes were applied correctly:
Executed grep -n "Buy Now" client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
Perfect! Now all "Pay Now" buttons have been changed to "Buy Now" to indicate that customers will pay in full upfront for equipment purchases.
Now let's check the current status of our Pro Calculator section:
Opened client/src/pages/pricing.tsx
Based on my review of the recent work, I see:
✓ Updated pricing structure with three tiers for furnaces/AC units
✓ Changed all "Pay Now" buttons to "Buy Now" for equipment purchases
✓ Added Pro Calculator with $500 paywall as requested
✓ Updated the maintenance plan section with proper pricing
I'm making good progress implementing the changes you requested. I'm currently working on ensuring the equipment purchases (furnaces, AC units) direct customers to pay in full upfront when they click "Buy Now." I'll continue making these improvements to match your requirements.

I'll create an admin bypass for the Pro Calculator so you can access it without needing to pay. Let me set that up for you:
Opened client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
Let's create an admin access option for the Pro Calculator. I'll implement:
An admin login component for the Pro Calculator
An authentication mechanism to bypass the paywall with admin credentials
First, let's create a component for the Pro Calculator login:
Opened client/src/components/calculators/EnergyCalculator.tsx
Now, let's create a new Pro Calculator component with admin login bypass:
Created client/src/components/calculators/ProCalculator.tsx
Now, let's create a page to access the Pro Calculator:

I understand you need a more detailed quote calculator that provides an exhaustive price breakdown including materials, labor, and other costs. Let me expand the Pro Calculator to include this comprehensive functionality, referencing the pricing details from your original document.
Let's create an additional tab in the Pro Calculator specifically for generating detailed quotes:
Edited client/src/components/calculators/ProCalculator.tsx
Now let's add the detailed job quoter component with all the pricing elements from your original document:
Edited client/src/components/calculators/ProCalculator.tsx
Now, let's add the type for the quote form and add the missing variables:
Edited client/src/components/calculators/ProCalculator.tsx
also the 500$ fee should be 2000$ and it should be 29$ a month or 250 a year

Looking at the recent work:
✓ Added admin access to Pro Calculator
✓ Added Job Quoter tab with detailed form schema
→ Updating Pro Calculator pricing structure
I see that you want to:
Have a detailed quote calculator that accounts for all materials and costs
Change pricing from $500 one-time fee to $2,000 one-time OR subscription options ($29/month or $250/year)
I'll continue implementing these changes, starting with the updated pricing model.
